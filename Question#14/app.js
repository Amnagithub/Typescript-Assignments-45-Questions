// Q14:Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
// make a list of guest:
var guest = ['Hina', 'Nazia', 'Shazia'];
// creat a loop
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    // print an invitation message to all guest 
    console.log("Hi ".concat(guest[i], ",\n\n I would like to invite you a dinner at my home tommorow.\n\n Thank You"));
}
